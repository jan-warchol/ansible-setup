This is a source of truth about SSH public keys that I'm interested in
(including my own, since I want to easily configure ssh access between my
machines). I used to keep this info in password manager (together with key
passphrases), but it's not easily accessible then (and ansible doesn't have a
means to save data into password store from a task).
