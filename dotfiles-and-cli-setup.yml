# This role installs my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jan-warchol/dotfiles).
# Basically, the dotfiles repository should contain only user configuration
# that is common to all my accounts, and is reasonable to track as plain
# text files.  In particular, nothing here should depend on any ansible
# group_vars or host_vars.
#
# Any configs that don't meet these requirements (system-wide settings, GUI
# settings that live in binary files or unwieldy XMLs, etc.) should be
# managed by some other means.  In particular, settings that differ between
# accounts live in `user-config` role.
